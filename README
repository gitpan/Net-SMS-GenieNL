Net::SMS::GenieNL
=================

Description
-----------

This package contains a class sending SMS's via the free SMS service of
www.genie.nl. It supports multiple user accounts to help overcome the max
20 SMS's per day limit. It also can maintain a persistent state hash in
which the state of the user accounts is saved so that login's aren't always
necessary etc.
